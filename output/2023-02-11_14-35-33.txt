Q: What is MapReduce?; 
A: MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. It involves a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. 

Q: What are the major contributions of this work?; 
A: The major contributions of this work are a simple and powerful interface that enables automatic parallelization and distribution of large-scale computations, combined with an implementation of this interface that achieves high performance on large clusters of commodity PCs. 

Q: What is the purpose of MapReduce?; 
A: The purpose of MapReduce is to provide a programming model and implementation for processing and generating large data sets. It allows programmers to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system without experience in parallel and distributed systems. 

Q: Who wrote the paper 'MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters'?; 
A: The paper 'MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters' was written by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat of Google, Inc. 

Q: What is the primary mechanism for fault tolerance in MapReduce?; 
A: The primary mechanism for fault tolerance in MapReduce is re-execution. This allows the system to detect and recover from failures in the cluster.
