      "Question": "What are the benefits of writing?",
      "Answer": "Writing is not just a way to convey ideas, but also a way to have them. A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery."

    {
      "Question": "What does reading teach us?",
      "Answer": "Reading about something doesn't just teach you about that thing; it also teaches you how to write."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What kind of thinking can be done without writing?",
      "Answer": "If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can sometimes solve it in your head."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is the importance of reading well?",
      "Answer": "You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well without reading well. And I mean that last \"well\" in both senses. You have to be good at reading, and read good things."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is the conclusion of the text?",
      "Answer": "People who just want information may find other ways to get it. But people who want to have deep understanding of the world will always need to read and write."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is the main point of audiobooks?",
      "Answer": "Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having them read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading them yourself."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is meant by being \"good at reading\"?",
      "Answer": "Being \"good at reading\" does not mean being good at the mechanics of reading. It means being able to extract meaning from the words."
