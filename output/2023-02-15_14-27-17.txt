Q: What is the programming model associated with MapReduce?;
A: MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. It is a functional style of programming which is automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the programâ€™s execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication.;

Q: What are the two functions associated with MapReduce?;
A: MapReduce consists of two functions: a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.;

Q: What are the advantages of MapReduce?;
A: MapReduce allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. It is highly scalable, easy to use, and can process many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. It also hides the messy details of parallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution, and load balancing in a library.;

Q: What are the major contributions of MapReduce?;
A: The major contributions of MapReduce are a simple and powerful interface that enables automatic parallelization and distribution of large-scale computations, combined with an implementation of this interface that achieves high performance on large clusters of commodity PCs.;

Q: What is the primary mechanism for fault tolerance in MapReduce?;
A: The primary mechanism for fault tolerance in MapReduce is re-execution. This means that if a machine fails during the computation, the task can be re-executed on another machine, thus allowing the overall computation to complete successfully.
